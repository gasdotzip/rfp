# Gas.zip RFP



[Gas.zip](https://gas.zip) is the fastest one-stop gas refuel bridge for 175+ chains and 50+ LayerZero chains where users can instantly bridge to multiple destination chains with a single inbound transaction. Since launch Gas has helped hundreds of thousands of wallets reload gas on over 200+ chains and has grown to become a [top LayerZero application](https://layerzeroscan.com/protocol/gas.zip) in just under five months. Gas upgraded to LayerZero v2 just days after its release, and we are excited to continue building products atop the LayerZero network.



## Distribution Plan:



The distribution plan aims to reward the type of usage that would continue to contribute to sustained product usage and organic community growth, with a heavy weight towards Gas LayerZero users. These are the users who are most likely to return to the product, use new products of ours and continue to build the Gas.zip ecosystem. As recommended by LayerZero, 10% will be granted in a developer allocation and **90% of the RFP will be distributed to users**, broken down as follows:



+ **75.00%** - Gas LayerZero Reload Users

+ **20.00%** - Gas Reload Users

+ **4.00%** - Gas LayerZero Inscriptions Users

+ **1.00%** - Integrators & Significant Supporters



Of each of these groups, a weighted scoring system is used to rank usage across different criteria. Each criteria contains three possible outcomes, of which the score is summed for that group and divided among the groupâ€™s allocation, referenced above. All data is as of the LayerZero RFP snapshot date of May 1st, 2024. 



### Gas LayerZero Reload Users (75.00%):



We believe users who used the Gas LayerZero Reload should receive the bulk of the rewards from this LayerZero RFP. A base filter is applied to the initial unique wallet set of 279,902 addresses, ranking the results by three sections of activity: **base usage, usage over time and volume reloaded**. We believe this criteria fairly distributes weight across meaningful usage of the Gas LayerZero Reloade. 



**Base Filter:** All transactions below $0.01 and any addresses with less than $5.00 in lifetime reload volume are excluded.



**Base Activity:**

+ **1 Point** - 5+ Inbound Transactions and 10+ Unique Chains

+ **2 Points** - 10+ Inbound Transactions and 15+ Unique Chains

+ **3 Points** - 15+ Inbound Transactions and 25+ Unique Chains



**Usage Over Time:**

+ **1 Point** - Used in 2+ Unique Months

+ **3 Points** - Used in 3+ Unique Months

+ **6 Points** - Used in 4+ Unique Months



**Volume Reloaded:**

+ **1 Point** - Reloaded $25+ All Time 

+ **3 Points** - Reloaded $50+ All Time 

+ **6 Points** - Reloaded $100+ All Time 



The maximum point allocation for this group is 15. An address receives the full point amount of the highest criteria met.



### Gas.zip Reload Users (20.00%):



Gas.zip Reload users were our initial userbase, and a significant amount of Gas.zip users did not hesitate to try out the LayerZero reloader when it launched. These users helped us validate our product market fit and gave us the confidence to move forward and build the LayerZero reloader. A base filter is applied to the initial unique wallet set of 51,343 addresses, ranking the results by three sections of activity: **base usage, usage over time and volume reloaded**.



**Base Filter:** All transactions below $0.01 and any addresses with less than $10.00 in lifetime reload volume are excluded.



**Base Activity:**

+ **1 Point** - 2+ Inbound Transactions and 5+ Unique Chains

+ **2 Points** - 5+ Inbound Transactions and 10+ Unique Chains

+ **3 Points** - 10+ Inbound Transactions and 25+ Unique Chains



**Usage Over Time:**

+ **1 Point** - Used in 2+ Unique Months

+ **3 Points** - Used in 5+ Unique Months

+ **6 Points** - Used in 6+ Unique Months



**Volume Reloaded:**

+ **1 Point** - Reloaded $25+ All Time 

+ **3 Points** - Reloaded $50+ All Time 

+ **6 Points** - Reloaded $250+ All Time 



The maximum point allocation for this group is 15. An address receives the full point amount of the highest criteria met.



### Gas LayerZero Inscriptions Users (4.00%):



The $GWEI LayerZero Inscriptions were an experiment launched in parallel with LayerZero deploying V2 of the protocol, and an attempt to try something new. We appreciate everyone that participated in minting $GWEI and believe their willingness to experiment on LayerZero should be rewarded. No base filter has been applied to this group; however, a much smaller allocation has been assigned to it due to the realistic substantive nature of the protocol interaction. 



**Average Inscription Cost:**

+ **1 Point** - Paid $0.75+ per Inscription

+ **2 Points** - Paid $1.25+ per Inscription

+ **3 Points** - Paid $2.00+ per Inscription



**Inscription Mints:**

+ **1 Point** - Minted 10,000+ Inscriptions

+ **3 Points** - Minted 25,000+ Inscriptions

+ **6 Points** - Minted 100,000+ Inscriptions



**Fees Paid:**

+ **1 Point** - Paid $25+ Inscription Fees

+ **3 Points** - Paid $100+ Inscription Fees

+ **6 Points** - Paid $250+ Inscription Fees



The maximum point allocation for this group is 15. An address receives the full point amount of the highest criteria met.



### Integrators & Significant Supporters (1.00%):



A base allocation of 1.00% of the community RFP amount will be distributed to Gas.zip integrators and users who provided significant testing and feedback or support in some meaningful way during the building of Gas.zip. This is a small group of people of which we personally requested an address from to allocate here. None of these recipients have any affiliation with Gas.zip. 



## List of Addresses:



None of these addresses have been filtered for sybil activity. Our intention is to segment and reward user activity by criteria we feel best reflects an active and real user. Based on the currently published LayerZero sybil list, we would expect ~10% of addresses to be filtered from this list. Additionally, we have manually removed Gas.zip affiliated addresses from all user lists. 



Points are not all equal in the distribution above. The global list calculates total eligibility amount across all four groups, and the segmented lists are the point totals for that individual group. 



### Global List (90% of 100%):



The global list contains all eligible addresses and their weighted amount of the total RFP, calculated by the sum of their total allocation in each four eligible groups above. 



+ **(90% of 100%)** - [Gas.zip RFP - Global Airdrop List](https://github.com/gasdotzip/rfp/raw/abf021300ad9678047fc48d0d084be362ec67fd8/global.csv)



The global list should be used for the 90% user allocation. 



#### Segmented Lists: 



The segmented lists contain all eligible addresses separated by each group and their total eligible percent of that individual groups allocation. 



+ **(75% of 90%)** - [Gas.zip RFP - Gas LayerZero Reload Users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasdotzip/rfp/abf021300ad9678047fc48d0d084be362ec67fd8/layerzero.csv)

+ **(20% of 90%)** - [Gas.zip RFP - Gas.zip Reload Users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasdotzip/rfp/abf021300ad9678047fc48d0d084be362ec67fd8/gas.csv) 

+ **(4% of 90%)** - [Gas.zip RFP - Gas LayerZero Inscriptions Users](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasdotzip/rfp/abf021300ad9678047fc48d0d084be362ec67fd8/inscriptions.csv) 

+ **(1% of 90%)** - [Gas.zip RFP - Integrators & Significant Supporters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gasdotzip/rfp/abf021300ad9678047fc48d0d084be362ec67fd8/integrators.csv) 



The segmented lists should be used for checking and referencing the global allocation.



### Developer Allocation (10% of 100%): 



The 10% developer allocation can be granted to the [Gas.zip deployer address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c968f6bEecf1906710b08e8B472b8Ba6E75F957).
